# My First Independent Python Project - (OGIDISE) A Board Game

This is a simulation of a traditional board game in Benin City called 'Ogidise'. It can only be played by two players facing opposite each other. Each player has their own section of the board. Each section comprises 6 smaller pots (holes) and 1 large reserve pot. At the beginning, all the pots (12) are filled with 4 stones each making a total of 48 stones in play

The first player picks the stones from any of their pots that they want, and holds in their hand. Then, moving in a clockwise direction, they drop one stone at a time from their hand into the following pot across the board, until their hand is empty.

CHANGE OF PLAYER TURN: If their last stone falls into an empty pot, then the next player's turn begins. Else, the player picks all the stones in last pot they dropped into and continues dropping one stone in each following pot as they continue moving clockwise.

CLAIM: If their last stone falls into an opponent's pot containing three stones thereby making it four stones, they own those four stones. And empty that opponent's pot into their reserve, thereby reducing the total number of stones in play by four.

WIN: Generally, the player in possession of a higher number of stones (including the stones in their reserve) wins the game. An indisputable winner emerges when a player succeeds in emptying all the pots of their opponent.
