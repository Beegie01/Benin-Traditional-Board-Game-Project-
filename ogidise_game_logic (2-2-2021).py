OGIDISE BOARD GAME

GAME PLAY:
Start: Roll dice to determine who goes first

Both players pick a side (set of six pots each) out of two sides

Player's Turn
- player must choose which of his six pots which content he wants to empty into his hands

- first player transfers the content of the chosen pot to his hand

- moving from left to right, the player drops one stone into each pot that he passes. When he gets to the end of his section, he crosses over to the opponent's section and continues to drop one stone into each pot

- after dropping the last stone in his hand, if the last stone was dropped into an empty pot, player cannot continue and turn changes to the next player. Else, player empties the pot and continues the cycle (until the last stone hits an empty pot).




WIN CHECK:
- POT CLAIM: when the last stone dropped hits an opponent's pot containing three stones thereby making it a total of four stones. This means that the player empties the pot into his reserve and play continues without those four stones.

- Player with the highest number of stones in his section wins the game

- Player also wins if an opponent has no stone in his section.
